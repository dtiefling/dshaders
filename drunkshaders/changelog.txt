(0.3.0)
Complete refactor!
Common content separated in files used to build all shaders.
Reduced attempts to fix issues that happen with the original game shaders
anyways.
Reverse engineered parameters of texture samplers, slightly different dependent
on shader.
Much less details lost in rendering.
Much less false positives.
Separate code detects different kinds of errors (object tiles,
blended object tiles, animations with transparency). It's an attempt to remove
all lines for object tiles and animations with transparency, and highly
reduce their number for blended object tiles.

(0.2.6.1)
Bugfix!

(0.2.6)
Remove heuristic border detection via preprocessor for shaders other than
fpdraw.
Modify the heuristic border detection in order to account for: spell
animations with alpha, blended light objects and static object tiles.
Also not to break effect icons. It is not perfect, but my best idea so far.

(0.2.5)
Reduced number of false positives in heuristic border detection.
Extended movies support (common tiling logic, introduced fpyuvgry.glsl).

(0.2.4)
Restored some alpha values.
Added heuristic detection of right/bottom texture borders.
Added new color modes.
Fixed outlines of cloud forms of vampires/efreeti.
Initial movies support (fpyuv.glsl).

(0.2.3)
Added changelog.
Fixed alpha adjustment for fpdraw-like shaders.
Lowered gamma change in the recommended settings (+2% instead of +10%).

(0.2.2)
Fixed issues specific for Windows VM.

(0.2.1)
Oops, wrong templates were included in 0.2. Fixed.

(0.2)
Fixed object tiles on the map (identified by @Parys).
Disabled options that would apply different settings to UI and map.
Created an ugly fix for fonts gamma in the author's setup (Infinity UI++).

(0.1)
Unified all the shaders.
Reimplemented outlines, added option to control their size.
Expanded WeiDU script to perform some patches through user dialog or choose
a preset via quick menu.
Heavily updated readme, including screenshots.


Older changes, as traced in the Beamdog forums thread:

(2023-09-16)
WeiDUized the contents. Created readme.

Fixed pixel shifts for Catmull-Rom so it looks properly for sprites.
Added options to disable outlines.

(2023-09-15)
Prepared some install on Windows VM to test compatibility there too.
Fixed the related memory leaks and incompatible code.
Pointed out by @argent77.

Added initial Catmull-Rom implementation.
Sugested by @Allanon81
