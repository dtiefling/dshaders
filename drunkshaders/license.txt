# drunktiefling's shaders

Readme last updated at version: *0.3.4*.

This mod aims to use more consistent color operations, sharpening
and alternative scaling filters via shader files introduced in BG(2)EE.

Further work resulted in a comprehensive attempt to improve or alter the game
behavior via GLSL shaders that provice extra functionality, yet attempt
to keep the performance as good as technically possible.

[Options overview](#options-overview), [Manual settings](#manual-settings),
or [Preview](#preview) section.

### Scope

This mod makes it possible to configure rendering of different elements
on the screen other than videos. Every setting but the main component
is optional. This includes:
* Brightness / contrast / gamma correction.
* Hue correction by rotation of linear RGB matrix
  (using YIQ-like approach rather than HSV).
* Saturation correction.
* Gausian image sharpening based on 4x4 surrounding.
* Catmull-Rom interpolation for scaling.
* Removal or change of the outlines for default/selected sprites
  (BGEE v1.3-style).
* Appearance of the selection outlines and coloring of selected objects.
* Handling of selected technical issues.

The main component, required for any other change, makes sure that:
* The shaders are reimplemented in a consistent way.
	* Notably, rendering of sprite outlines is approached differently,
	  even though some configurations yield results that are visually similar
	  to the unmodded game.
* All the color mixing operations are performed in linear RGB space.
* Besides the error check, the data comes straight from the texels.
  By default, no texel is probed from the texture more than once.
* Shaders configuration can be adjusted with a text editor such as notepad.

From version 0.3.3, this mod is maintained with special performance-related
features in mind, which include:
* Avoiding conditional statements in the implementation.
* Extra component that runs
  [GLSL optimizer](https://github.com/jamienicol/glsl-optimizer) over
  all the shaders, after their content (coming from the installer,
  its presets and manual edition) can be considered final.

### Thanks to Argent77

I mean, really, it would not be possible without Argent77's work
on [Shader Pack](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-LightingPackEE). Showcase
of such potential and detailed README on what each shader file does
has been crucial for the development of this mod.

Since many ideas were redesigned rather than extended, this is a rewrite
of said *Shader Pack*. As such, these two mods are **not compatible**.

### Requirements

BG2EE with 2.6-series patch. As it's all about engine, mods such as EET
are compatible by default.

**Note:** Some settings in the game may indirectly disable some features
of this mod. On Windows platform, you should **disable** "Alternate Renderer"
in the graphic options of the games in order to see anything that this mod
provides. If you want Catmull-Rom interpolation to work, you also need
to **disable** "Nearest Neighbor Scaling".

As it comes to the game settings, one non-obligatory recommendation is
to **disable** the hardware cursor. It doesn't scale like the cursors
used to in the traditional game, and it might be confusing when it moves
faster than some objects.

### Conflicts

*Shader Pack* by Argent77. It simply replaces it.

Anything that replaces `fpDraw`, `FPFONT`, `fpSeam`, `FPSELECT`, `FPSPRITE`,
`fpTone`, `fpYUV` or `fpYUVGRY` shader.

For now, said files are not patched, but replaced. It is mostly justified
by different approach to color mixing, which - while perhaps possible -
would be remarkably hard to implement otherwise.

### Installation

This is a [WeiDU](https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases) mod. Extract
it in the game installation directory.

Unless you know extra WeiDU options you might want to specify,
`weinstall drunkshaders`
would do. Make sure to have weinstall in your `PATH` (or use absolute path,
whatever).

On Windows, you might find it convenient to make yet another copy
of WeiDU (`weidu.exe`) and name it `Setup-drunkshaders.exe`.
Then you can as well remove it and make new copy before
uninstalling/reinstalling. This file is never modified otherwise.

If you need this, get archive with your `weidu.exe`
on https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases .

## Options overview

Please note that each subcomponent also includes an option not to change
anything.

 - **Quick menu** - it offers you some predefined setups, so you can avoid
   answering that many questions, some of them somewhat technical.
 - **Adjustable shaders coded by a drunk tiefling [Main component]** - you
   need it in order to install any functions provided by the mod. It makes
   all the color fixing based on linear RGB and replaces the implementation
   of sprite outlines.
 - *Scaling filter* - for now it lets you choose which shaders should use
   Catmull-Rom interpolation algorithm. BGEE 1.3 was famous for using it,
   but it was there only for sprites. With this mod, you can apply it in
   more places (which makes a remarkable difference for maps).
	 - **Use Catmull-Rom interpolation for sprites only**
	 - **Use Catmull-Rom interpolation in all shaders**
	   (this involves UI and fonts too).
 - *Outline changes* - the default settings imitate BG(2)EE 2.6 behavior.
   You can change it. BGEE 1.3 didn't render any sprite outlines at all.
	 - **Disable sprite outlines in non-selected sprites** - so it's like
	   BGEE 1.3 + selection outlines, which can be considered as a quality
	   of life addidtion of further patches.
	 - **Disable sprite outlines in non-selected sprites, make them thinner
	 for selected ones** - similar to the option above, but colorful outlines
	 of the selected sprites are thinner. It makes them slightly more
	 consistent with other objects in the game.
	 - **Disable sprite outlines in all sprites** - as it was in BGEE 1.3.
 - *Color fixes*
	 - **Use moderate color adjustments (gamma +2%, contrast +10%,
	   brightness +5%), sprites only** - slighter changes than the recommended
	   setting of *Shader Pack*, as it is performed in linear space and might
	   require less changes due to Catmull-Rom options. It affects sprites
	   only.
	 - **Use moderate color adjustments (gamma +2%, contrast +10%,
	   brightness +5%), all shaders** - slighter changes than the recommended
	   setting of *Shader Pack*, for all the shaders.
	 - **Use recommended color adjustments (gamma +2%, contrast +20%,
	   brightness +10%), sprites only** - similar to the recommended
	   setting of *Shader Pack*, but only for the sprites (no maps, UI
	   or fonts). Remarkably, this settings avoids gamma increase
	   for all text (also rendered alongside UI).
	 - **Use recommended color adjustments (gamma +2%, contrast +20%,
	   brightness +10%), all shaders** - just similar to the recommended
	   setting of *Shader Pack*.
 - *Sharpening / blur*
	 - **Sharpen slightly (+0.25), sprites only** -
	   recommended if you don't want to touch maps and UI.
	 - **Sharpen slightly (+0.25), all shaders** -
	   recommended if you are alright with changing everything on the screen.
	 - **Sharpen more (+0.50), sprites only**
	 - **Sharpen more (+0.50), all shaders**
	 - **Blur slightly (-0.25 sharpen), sprites only**
	 - **Blur slightly (-0.25 sharpen), all shaders**
	 - **Blur more (-0.50 sharpen), sprites only**
	 - **Blur more (-0.50 sharpen), all shaders**
 - *Font fixes* - the main shader responsible for fonts is `fpfont.glsl`,
   but some pieces of text are rendered by `fpdraw.glsl` alongside the UI.
   Text is known to be easier to read with somehat lower gamma (such as 0.8),
   but such a low setting might be suboptimal for the UI.
	 - **Lower gamma for fonts shader only (set to 0.8)**
	 - **Lower gamma for fonts shader (set to 0.8) + use color-based hack
	   to lower fonts gamma in some UIs (Dragonspear UI++, Infinity UI++))**
	   Some pieces of text, such as item counts on stacks, are rendered
	   by the UI shader rather than font shader. So they use the same code
	   as UI and object tiles on the maps, which should have the same color
	   settings as maps themselves. Which makes it hard to separate this
	   case and apply lower gamma.
	   In UI mods such as Infinity UI++, this issue is especially visible,
	   as the pieces of text are just presented in easily scalable font
	   rather than bitmaps known from the original games. But color of such
	   fonts was easy enough to separate to match the right pixels by color.
	   It barely touches anything else in the UI, and in the case of object
	   tiles the transition around potentially mismatched pixels is smooth.
	   It's a controversial choice and a total hack, but that's how I play
	   this mod.
 - *Hue change* - initially, some change seemed to be beneficial.
   However, after going through more areas, I believe that no change should
   be included in the recommended setups. If you want to play with it,
   just choose an option for this subcomponent specifically
   (or edit the files).
	 - **Make colors warmer (hue +3.0 deg), sprites only**
	 - **Make colors warmer (hue +3.0 deg), all shaders**
	 - **Make colors remarkably warmer (hue +5.0 deg), sprites only**
	 - **Make colors remarkably warmer (hue +5.0 deg), all shaders**
	 - **Make colors colder (hue -3.0 deg), sprites only**
	 - **Make colors colder (hue -3.0 deg), all shaders**
	 - **Make colors remarkably colder (hue -5.0 deg), sprites only**
	 - **Make colors remarkably colder (hue -5.0 deg), all shaders**

## Manual settings

This version of the mod just puts some example setup in your game files.

You are going to have `fpdraw.glsl`, `fpfont.glsl`, `fpseam.glsl`,
`fpselect.glsl` and `fpsprite.glsl` in your `override` folder. And you can
play with them using text editor such as `vim`/`notepad`/`Notepad++`/...
They are written in *OpenGL Shading Language*.

If you are not familiar with *OpenGL Shading Language*, some changes might
get you a black screen, game crash or unexpected colors. But you can keep
it mostly safe by modifying the top 15 lines of each file only.

Most likely, you want to have similar values in `fpsprite.glsl`
and `fpselect.glsl`. Otherwise, each file describes another
part of a screen. I will post my observations, which are slightly different
from [Argent77's research](https://argent77.github.io/A7-LightingPackEE/).

* `fpfont.glsl`     - Font rendering (everything but item counts/uses
                      on stacks).
* `fpseam.glsl`     - Map background.
* `fpdraw.glsl`     - User interface including inventory (and item counts
                      on stacks, which are **not affected** by `fpfont.glsl`).
                      Also the fog of war.
                      Also objects in BG2EE maps that have separate tiles,
                      such as bathtub of Aran Linvail. As such, you should
                      keep the color correction settings similar to
                      `fpseam.glsl`.
* `fptone.glsl`       - Object tiles on a map when the game is paused.
                        Just keep it similar to `fpdraw.glsl`.
* `fpsprite.glsl`   - Character sprites, software cursors, ground icons, ...
* `fpselect.glsl`   - Some of the content from `fpsprite.glsl` when
                      it's selected.
                      Or when something close is selected.
                      Not really consistent, but that's how the game
                      seems to use it.

## Setup recommendations

Technical suggestions on what values to use are in the files.

Otherwise, some settings I would recommend for most displays are:
* Gamma lower than 1.0 in `fpfont.glsl` (fonts are known to look good
  with gamma 1.8 rather than ~2.2 of *sRGB*, so values close to 1.8/2.2
  might make sense).
* Something like: gamma: 1.1, contrast: x1.2, brightness: +0.1 for
  `fpseam.glsl`, `fpsprite.glsl`, and `fpselect.glsl`. Such numbers are
   inspired by the recommended option of Argent77's *Shader Pack*.
* Minor changes to `fpdraw.glsl` unless you want to consistently adjust
  the whole screen. This shader describes the small digits of stack/use
  counts of items, so gamma lower than 1.0 might make it easier to read.
*  `fpsprite.glsl` and `fpselect.glsl` contain extra parameter, that can
  be used to disable or modify normal and selected sprite outlines,
  respectively.
  The attached setup disables black outlines (`fpsprite.glsl`), yet keeps
  the colored versions on selection.
  For the most BGEE v1.3-like experience (some people seem to miss it),
  make sure to keep Catmull-Rom setting enabled and disable all outlines.
